# Hi, I'm Asma 👋

I'm a full-stack developer based in Dubai. I build things end-to-end — from the database up to the UI — mostly with TypeScript, React, Next.js, Node.js, and PostgreSQL.

Currently looking for **remote developer roles**.

## Projects

### [Argus](https://github.com/Asma1ak/argus) — Critical Thinking Assistant
An AI-powered web app that analyses text for logical fallacies, cognitive biases, and manipulation tactics, giving each submission a 0–100 logic score.

Built as a full PWA with JWT auth, analysis history, an analytics dashboard, PDF/JSON exports, and shareable links. Comes with a browser extension for in-page analysis, Playwright E2E tests, and a GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline. Fully containerised with Docker Compose.

`TypeScript · React · Node.js · Express · PostgreSQL · Docker · Playwright`

### [Praxis](https://github.com/Asma1ak/praxis) — Decision Journal
A personal decision-tracking app where you log decisions, track assumptions with probability scores, write outcome notes, and schedule reviews.

Uses Next.js App Router, PostgreSQL full-text search with GIN indexes, a Redis background job queue for reminders, and NextAuth with Prisma middleware for multi-tenant data isolation.

### [Foundation API](https://github.com/Asma1ak/foundation-api) — NestJS Boilerplate
A production-ready starter template for NestJS APIs — JWT auth with refresh token rotation, RBAC, Zod validation, Swagger docs, centralised error handling, and a full CI pipeline.
